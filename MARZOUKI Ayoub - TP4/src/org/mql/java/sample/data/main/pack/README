This package contains a whole set of classes and sub packages, which will serve as a sample data to test if the diagrams created by our project will actually be accurate and correct.

We want to test every possible combination of relations of package diagrams and class diagrams.

Each class will be documented, to inform the reader about its characteristics; from fields to what it extends and/or implements.
